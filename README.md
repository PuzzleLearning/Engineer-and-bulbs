Engineer-and-bulbs
==================

There are **1 000 light bulbs** numerated from **1** to **1 000**. An engineer created a switching mechanism, which switches a state of a single light bulbs (from "turned off" to "turned on" and vice versa) in a peculiar way. If the switch was pressed *k*-time, the state of all light bulbs which index is divided by *k* changes. At the beginning, all light bulbs are turned off. Experiment starts:

After first switch (which is *k = 1*) all light bulbs are turned on.
After second switch (which is *k = 2*) even light bulbs are turned off, and odd light bulbs stay turned on.
After third switch (*k = 3*) all bulbs, which numbers are odd and divisible by 3 and all bulbs, which numbers are even and divisible by 3, are turned on. Rest of the light bulbs are turned off.
